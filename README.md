# Grumblr-Web-Application
 A web Application like blogging - site for social connection.

This is my personal peoject. I implemented it by five steps.

How to run this project:
For the folder 1 to 4, you could download folders into your computer and run the command below:
(1) Enter the directory containing manage.py.
(2) Run python manage.py makemigrations, then run python manage.py migrate.
(3) Run python manage.py runserver.
(4) Open the http://127.0.0.1:8000/ by your browser.

For the folder five, because I deploy this project in the AWS EC2, and use the S3 to store the data. It need to pay
fees. When I implement this project, I terminate the instance. But it is easy to deploy, all the configurations file are
included in this folder. You could start a instance in the AWS and using the configuration file to deploy it. Then
everyone who has your project url could access your website. You could view that works well.
