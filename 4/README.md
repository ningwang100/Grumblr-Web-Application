**********************************************************
Special Hints:

1.Design the user's email can not be changed in the edit page.Thus,I set the email widget just readonly.It is not a bug,it just
a design idea.

2.I design the user ont only could upload an image in the edit page, but also could upload an image as his avatar when he
register an account.

3.In the home page and follower page, the right side has recommended friends and my follower list.If the current user follow
a user,it will display in the my follower list and remove from the recommended list.If current user unfollow a user,the user
will display in the recommended friend list and remove from my follower list.
