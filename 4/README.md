You could use these registered username and password to log in the grumblr,you also could sign up a new user in

In homework5, I add a global_stream.js file to implement the update features with any new posts every five seconds.
You could open two browser and login in two different user to test the updated feature. When you post a grumblr from
one browser, the other brower also will get the grumblr within five seconds.

I also implement the update for the follower page. If you follow your friend. When you friend post a grumblrs, you could
see the grumblr updated in your follower page.

I also add the comment functionality in global, follower and profile page.You could add comments anywhere posts are shown
to you.When you add a comment in one browser,then go to the other browser, click the coresponding post's reply button, you 
also could see the comment.
